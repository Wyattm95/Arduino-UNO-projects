## Description
This project demonstrates RGB color mixing using an Arduino. 
Analog inputs are used to read sensor values that control the brightness of the red, green, and blue channels of an RGB LED through PWM outputs. 
The raw and mapped values are displayed in the Serial Monitor for debugging and calibration.
