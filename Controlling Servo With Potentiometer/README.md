## Description
This project uses a potentiometer to control the position of a servo motor. 
The Arduino reads the analog input from the potentiometer, maps the value 
to a servo angle between 0° and 179°, and moves the servo accordingly. 
The raw sensor value and the mapped angle are displayed in the Serial Monitor for debugging.
